# Qiskit Transpilation Noise
Code to set up examples of quantum circuits and see how the transpiler affects them and introduces noise into the computations.

## How can I use this?
Feel free to download the Jupyter notebook in this repository and use it as a reference to better understand how to use Qiskit. You may also modify any piece of it to alter to see how outputs can change as the circuits are changed.
